Tests are implemented using cram (a simple CLI testing framework). In Debian
this is packaged as python3-cram.

Tests consist of a test file (test.t), some hbr configs (in configs dir), and
some hbr input files in a directory of the same name as the test file (test,
in this case). The test file contains the commands to be run (lines start with
two spaces, a $, then one space followed by the command)

Normally you can run these tests with the make target from your build directory:
    make test

For modifying, updating, or creating new tests an environment variable with your
hbr path needs to be set before running cram.
    export CRAM_HBR=/path/to/hbr/under/test/hbr

Then cram can be run manually on individual tests:
    cram3 test.t

Updating test output is done via an interactive mode:
    cram3 -i test.t

Cram will display a diff and ask for confirmation to update the test file with
the new output.

Notes on creating tests:
    Tests have to be reproducible on other platforms independent of the build
    location. My method for this so far is to use the $TESTDIR envvar provided
    by cram, then use sed to strip it out of all output and replace it with 
    a literal string "TESTDIR".

    Cram also uses a tmp directory for it's working directory. These random
    names also cause issues if they are included in test output.
