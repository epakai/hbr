handbrake runner (hbr)                      https://github.com/epakai/hbr
====================== 

This is a tool for automating the running of HandBrakeCLI and
allowing for encodes to be easily re-run with modified settings.

Usage is to specify an xml file for all relevant settings and an output
directory.

	hbr show.xml /video/show

You may also specify a specific episode from the xml file to be encoded.

	hbr show.xml -e 8 /video/show/

In order to generate an xml file run hbr with the -g option. Some tags
and options can be prefilled by the generator. See hbr --help for a list.
Output of hbr -g is to stdout. Redirect it to a file.

	hbr -g 12 --format=mkv --basedir=/video/iso > show.xml

This generates a file with 12 outfile sections. Edit this manually and
then feed it back into hbr to begin encoding.
